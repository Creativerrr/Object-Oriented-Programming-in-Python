#1 OOP termininology

#1.1 Classify the cards into the correct buckets. Are the statements true or false?

#True
#Attributes encode the state of an object and are represented by variables.
#Methods encode behavior of an object and are represented by functions.
#Encapsulation is a software design practice of the bundling the data and methods that operate on that data.

#False
#Object is an abstract template describing the general states and behaviors.
#Object and class are different terms describing  the same concept.
#A programming language can be either object-orented or procedural, but not both.
#.columns is an example of method of a DataFrame object. 

#1.2 Exploring object interface
#The best way to learn how to write object-oriented code is to study the design of existing classes.

#1.2.1 What class does the mystery object have?
#ANSWER  __main__.Employee

#1.2.2
# Print the mystery employee's name
print(mystery.name)

# Print the mystery employee's salary
print(mystery.salary)

#1.2.3 
# Print the mystery employee's name
print(mystery.name)

# Print the mystery employee's salary
print(mystery.salary)

# Give the mystery employee a raise of $2500
mystery.give_raise(2500)

# Print the salary again
print(mystery.salary)

#1.3 Understanding class definitions

def set_count(self, n):
    mc.set_count(5)
    mc.count = mc.count + 1
    mc=MyCounter()
